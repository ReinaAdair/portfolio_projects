This is a collection of multiple python projects that I think are not completely useless.
Guessing Suits:
    A card game where your goal is to guess the first card randomly pulled from a deck.
    The hints as to what the first card is are given in the form of comparisons to cards
    drawn after the first one. i.e. if the first card is the "Seven of Diamonds", and the
    second card is the "Four of Hearts", your hint would be, "Different Suit, Lower Value."

Tracker:
    A system for keeping track of employee points for an attendance system. Adds up the amount
    of points an employee has, and ensures those points are still valid in conjunction with
    the companies attendance policy.

    Status: In development

Deck:
    A simple python class that allows for user defined playing card decks. Allows drawing
    cards from the deck, shuffling the deck, and resetting the deck to its original state.

Encryption:
    A super simple encryption script that can go through and encrypt all the files in a
    specified folder using a key kept in a different file. And can also unencrypt the files
    using the same key.

Newegg Scraper:
    A web scraper that takes user input to search through Newegg's website to find all of
    the prices and names the are returned by searching their site with that search term
    and prints them to a text document in order of least expensive to most expensive.
